## Prompt 1

What are the main differences between Flexbox and Grid layouts? Describe scenarios where each layout system would be more suitable.

### Response 1

CSS provides two crucial layout systems to help a developer design and align elements properly on a webpage. These layout systems allow for easier spacing and positioning; developers no longer have to precisely position every element.

1. **Flexbox** offers a **1-dimensional** layout system that aids in _alignment_ of items, particularly in a **single row or column**. You have many styling properties available in terms of positioning these items, such as _creating even space between them, or aligning the items to be in the center of the page_. These are built-in to CSS, so you do not need to meticulously style each element to use these properties.
2. **Grid** offers a **2-dimensional** layout system, allowing us to place and style elements in different **vertical and horizontal alignments at the same time**. Grid allows us to control exactly how many rows/columns we want certain elements to take up. Similar to **Flexbox**, you can align and space items in a variety of preformatted ways.

When you want to style items in a **single** row or column, use **Flexbox**. When you want to style items in **multiple** rows and columns, use **Grid**.

## Prompt 2

What is the difference between `justify-content` and `align-items` in Flexbox? How does each property control the positioning of flex items within the container?

## Prompt 5

Imagine you are teaching a brief lesson on **mobile first design**. Your lesson should include the following information:

- An explanation of mobile first design and a few of the benefits of this approach
- A CSS code example demonstrating how to use media queries to adjust the layout of a container from mobile to desktop with either Flexbox or Grid (choose one).
- An explanation of the code example.
